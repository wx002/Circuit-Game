Circuit Game Made using Unity (Fall Semester 2019)

Circuit simulation platform aim to enhance the learning experience of circuits using C# unity
Simulation focus on implicit learning and intuitions of circuits without focusing on the numerical calculations
Mainly in charge of system design and integration of open source circuit solver, ngSPICE as back-end
Overall project management and assigning tasks for different team members
